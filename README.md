# Uber-data-analysis
## Overview

This project performs an exploratory data analysis (EDA) on Uber ride data to understand customer ride patterns, time-based demand variations, and trip behavior.
Using Python’s data analytics and visualization libraries, the notebook extracts meaningful insights from raw trip data.

##Tools & Libraries

Python 3
pandas – data manipulation and cleaning
numpy – numerical operations
matplotlib – static visualizations
seaborn – advanced data visualization

## Key Analyses Performed

Data loading and preprocessing
Exploration of date/time patterns
Analysis of trip frequency and popular hours
Visualization of daily, monthly, and hourly ride trends
Insights into pickup locations and high-demand periods

## Example Visualizations

Ride counts by hour and weekday
Monthly trends in ride volume
Correlation between distance and trip frequency
Heatmaps of peak hours and popular pickup zones
